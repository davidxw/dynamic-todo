description: Generate a specification for the Dynamic Todo app
---

Create an application that demonstrates the GitHub Copilot SDK by building a Dynamic Todo app. The app will demonstrate the Copilot SDK by allowing users to dynamically update the UI for their own copy of the app The app has two key layers:

1. **Core Framework**: A reusable UI engine that generatets dynamic React UI, integrated with a chat interface powered by the Copilot SDK. This layer should includes the following features:
   - Dynamic UI generation based on a fixed API schema for a To Do app
   - Start with a sample to do app UI
   - Separate chrome (e.g. a header) that enables users to interact with the chat interface, roll back UI changes etc, spearate from the ToDo app UI
   - Chat UI integrated with GitHub Copilot SDK to make the requested changes to the dynamic part of the code
   - A reset button that will reset all changes back the original same To Do app
   - A sample user switching interface to change to different sample users.
   - Chat interface should show reasoning and tools calls, as well as a summary of the code changes that have been made after each user request.  
   - UI code files stored locally on disk, separated by user

| **Sample Applications** | A sample to do application, should contain all the usual features of a to do app, such as adding, deleting, and marking tasks as complete. The UI should be generated by the Core Framework and should be modifiable through the chat interface. The API for the sample app should be fixed and extensive (i.e not all API features need to surfaced through the UI, there should be scope for additional UI features added by the user)

Keep the spec product-focused and easy to demo.

The product behavior MUST include:

- A clean, modern UI with both light and dark modes
- An MCP server that can serve up the UI components available to the sample App UI. The MCP server must be integrated into the Copilot SDK chat interface, allowing users to make changes to the UI through natural language commands.
